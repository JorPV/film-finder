# film-finder

I have been struggeling to get the assignment done. I could write funcions that work on their own but I didn't find the way to get them do what I wanted. 
So when clicking on the radio buttons, the eventListener fires and calls the filterMovies function. The result is the arrays of movies filtered by name or year. I wanted to connent the filtered arrays to each radio buttons so I would only have the selection of movies related, but I coudn't find the way to do it. 

I assume I have not passed this assignment and need to get more insights into JavaScript fundamentals.
